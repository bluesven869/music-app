## Setup instructions
We select sounds from music on playlists in your youtube account for now. To download them, we need a service. He might be a little heavy. To do this, you need to follow the service step and make sure that the device sends a request to the correct address.

#### Download
```console
git clone https://github.com/TPMinan/react-native-music-app
cd react-native-music-app
```

#### Start Metro Bundler
```console
npm install
npm start
```

#### IOS
```console
react-native run-ios
```

#### Android
The `localhost` address for the Service may not work on Android. You can use ip or place names instead
